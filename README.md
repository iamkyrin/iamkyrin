## About Me

I am a developer with a strong interest in combining **data, machine learning, and front-end engineering** to create useful and scalable solutions. I enjoy working on projects that require both analytical thinking and clean user-facing design.

My current focus is on strengthening my foundations in machine learning while continuing to build modern, responsive front-end applications. I value clean code, logical architecture, and continuous learning.
